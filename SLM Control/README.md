# 3D-SHOT 

This page contains lots of files related to "Precise multimodal optical control of neural ensemble activity" Nature Neuroscience  (10.1038/s41593-018-0139-8).  Included are software for generating targets from Tiff files produced from scanimage, a gui for creating sequences of holograms, and code for computing holograms and controling an SLM. Additionally we include code that allows a 3D spatial / power calibration translating the 'true' coordinate frame of the SLM to the 3D coordinate frame defined by the electrotunable lens.  We additionally include methods describing a model (supplemental Figure 23) and a schematic for our tuneable circuit that gates the stimulation laser based on the position of the resonant galvos.
